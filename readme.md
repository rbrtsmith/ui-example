#UI example

##Notes
* The framework used here is one I built myself inspired by the Inuit Framework that aims to focus only on architecture and not design / skin. 
* The framework has not yet been released to open source but the grid system I use has been released [https://github.com/rbrtsmith/rbrtsmith-grid](rbrtsmith-grid)
